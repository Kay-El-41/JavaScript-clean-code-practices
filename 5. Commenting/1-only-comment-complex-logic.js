// ! ONLY COMMENT WHAT IS COMPLEX LOGIC

// We have learned how to name functions or variables effectively.
// What's the point in commenting them to know what they do?

// Instead, comment on the complex logic, like email format matching or phone number matching.
// ? Example:
// " Validating the email by accepting 'any@any.any' format"
if (email.match(/^[^@]+@[^@]+/)) {
}
