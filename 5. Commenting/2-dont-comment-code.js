// ! DON'T COMMENT YOUR CODES

// If you leave a code commented, the one who continues to write or maintain the codes will be confused.
// Why did he commented? Is this code necessary for future? or not?
// He will have to browse through the code to find out why he didn't use it or keeping it for later?
// We are wasting time here. Never leave your codes commented.
// If it is not necessary, delete it. If you need it again, use version history and retrieve it or create a better one.
