// KISS = Keep It Simple, Stupid
//     Each line of code must have their own meaning, even a glance at code should be understandable.
// DRY = Don't  Repeat Yourself

// * The Advantages of Understandable Codes
// Time Saving for
//    - Maintenance
//    - Adding Features
//    - Long Term and Scalable Codebase

// ? Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares. There is nothing obvious you can do to make it better.
